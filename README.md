# Software-Piracy-Protection-System

This is a system that developed to protect the piracy of the software.
The goal of this system is to allow only authorised user to access the software.
The system allows users to pay for the software online and then back a license key.  
By so doing the system reads the computer MAC Address and then generates a license key to install the software.
On the installation, the system compares the computer MAC Address and the license key and then it verifies.
If the keys matches then it continues to install the software, else it cancels the installation process.
